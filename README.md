# Pulumi EKS Blueprints

Amazon EKS Blueprints for Pulumi are a set of useful components for simplifying common day zero through day two operations for Kubernetes.

**Warning**: This is an early preview of the Pulumi EKS Blueprints. The APIs and functionality are subject to change.

## How to use these

We don't recommend using these blueprints directly, as a dependency. Instead, these should be forked and considered your "platform" repository of which you can build upon these abstractions and components.

As we mature and stablise the API, these can be consumed as a dependency.
