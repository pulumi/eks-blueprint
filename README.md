# EKS Blueprints for Pulumi

Amazon EKS Blueprints for Pulumi are a set of useful components for simplifying common day zero through day two operations for Kubernetes.

**Note**: This is a preview of EKS Blueprints concepts and examples. The APIs and functionality are subject to change.

## How to use these

During the preview we expect to ship improvements and changes rapidly. We recommend forking these blueprints instead of using them as a direct dependency. Consider this your "platform" repository which you can build upon these abstractions and components. 

As we mature and stablize the API, these can be consumed as a dependency.
